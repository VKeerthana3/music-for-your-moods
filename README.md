<h1 align="center">Welcome to My Profile</h1>

I have developed a web application called Music for your Moods using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, EJS template engine, Express web framework, MongoDB database, and the Spotify Web API. This application is also deployed on Heroku and can be found here: https://immense-refuge-76074.herokuapp.com/login

This web application provides four main functionalities for the users:
1. Generates playlists based on the mood value entered by the user. They are generated from the top and followed artists’ tracks from their Spotify account.
   
2. Search for albums of an artist and save the details of the user’s search history (artist searched for and date) on the database.
   
3. Provides general functionalities such as viewing a user’s playlists, followed tracks, followed artists, as well as their albums and their corresponding tracks.
   
4. Allows a user to add a track to an existing playlist on their Spotify account. They can choose the track and playlist it should be added to, and this is also reflected on their Spotify account.
